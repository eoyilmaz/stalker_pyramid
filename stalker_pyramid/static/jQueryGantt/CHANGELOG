StalkerGantt Changes
====================

0.1.0.a4
--------

* **New:** Parent tasks and Projects are now collapsible.
* **Update:** The gantt chart is now able to display much more info then
  before. There are two new modes for each of the Grid and Gantt parts of the
  Gantt Chart. Grid can be set to display *Task*\ s or *Resources* and the
  Gantt can set to display *Task*\ s or *TimeLog*\ s.
* **Update:** Horizontal scrolling is disabled in gantt part of Gantt Chart.
  All the drawn tasks and links are now set in position with percent values, so
  they will stick and scale correctly when the split container resize.
* **Update:** Any task out of range is culled in gantt chart.
* **Update:** Added new buttons to change the range in -1/+1 month, -1/+1 week,
  -1/+1 day.
* **Update:** Replaced the **Date.format()** (originally replaced by
  jQueryGantt **date.js**) with **date.format.js** library.
* **Update:** Changed the background of the Grid and Gantt editors.
* **Update:** If the displayed tasks is clipped to the current start end range
  a double red border is displayed in the clipped start or end.
* **Update:** Context menu can now be opened in task names in grid editor.
* **Update:** Optimized the creation of task rows.
* **Update:** Replaced the ``input`` elements with ``div`` in the task row.
* **New:** Holding the mouse on Task bar elements will now show a popup window
  for more info.
* **Update:** Gantt Chart zoom levels are now fully controlled by the start and
  end date DateTextBoxes.
* **New:** Added a new button which will center the gantt chart on today.
* **Update:** Replaced the ``duration`` column with ``timing`` which correctly
  shows the schedule timing info of the related task.
* **Fix:** The ``depends`` column shows the dependent task names correctly.
* **Update:** jQueryGantt displays the owner Project of the Tasks as a
  container task.
* **Update:** Added content link (this will be updated to support proper links,
  hardcoded links to be removed).
* **Update:** Disabled drag and resize of TaskBar elements.
* **Update:** Moved the resource link code to the JST template code instead of
  the Task class.
* **Update:** The timing resolution of jQueryGantt is now 1 hour.
* **Fix:** GanttMaster.task_ids were not properly cleaned in
  GanttMaster.reset(), resulting wrong links to be created.

0.1.0.a3
--------
* TaskBar now shows the logged in time and shows them by painting the bar
  itself to green.
* Removed the TaskBid div, the extra time spent to a task is now shown with the
  TaskExtraTime div.
* Removed all the editing functions in the TaskGrid area.

0.1.0.a2
--------
* Fixed a lot of issues related with the new data structure, it seems
  everything is working properly right now.
* Parent Tasks displayed differently than the leaf tasks (on paar with the
  other gantt charts).
* Fix; t is now possible to correctly move a TaskBar without getting in to an
  infinite loop which was freezing the browser.
* The timing resolution of jQueryGantt is now 1 hour.
* Fix; GanttMaster.task_ids were not properly cleaned in GanttMaster.reset(),
  resulting wrong links to be created.
* Added a new zoom level where it is possible to see the every 1 hour of 1 day.
* Colorized the Sunday column in suitable zoom levels. In upcoming releases it
  will use the stalker.models.studio.Studio.working_hours attribute to
  determine if the day/hour is an off day/hour.

0.1.0.a1
--------
* Changed the data structure quite a bit.
* No `level` nor `rowId`, it is all related to the `Task.id`, `Task.parent_id`
  now, which far much better, because what you are viewing generally is a group
  of tasks which are not related to each other directly (tasks of a user from
  different branches), so putting a `level` will place them under the wrong
  task most of the time.
* There are new attributes like `bid`, `effort`, `length`, `children`,
  `depends_string`, `depends_ids`, `depends`, `parent_id`, `parent`,
  `is_scheduled`, `is_milestone`, `resources`, `resource_ids` in Task class.
* New attributes in GanttMaster for quick look up of tasks. Instead of
  looping through the GanttMaster.tasks list again and again to find one task
  with desired id, there is new attributes like GanttMaster.task_ids and
  GanttMaster.resource_ids for quick look up of the indexes. So finding a task
  becomes straight forward::
    
    index = GanttMaster.task_ids.index_of(desired_task_id)
    task = GanttMaster.tasks[index]
    # no need to tour around

* Removed all the editors windows, will use the custom coded Dojo UI to
  manipulate the Tasks.

0.0.1.a1
--------
* Added a new attribute ``parent`` to Task class. It will be used to properly
  implement the parent child relation of Tasks.
