Stalker Pyramid Changes
=======================

0.2.0
=====

* It is now possible to submit alembic export and playblast jobs to Afanasy
  when uploading new versions.

* Moved all the functions under ``views.anima`` to corresponding modules under
  ``views`` and deleted ``views.anima``.

* Fixed a huge ancient bug in ``views.link.MediaManager.upload_file()`` that
  corrupts the files over 128 kB of length by writing every 128 kB chunk twice.
  The resultant file size was nearly twice the original.
