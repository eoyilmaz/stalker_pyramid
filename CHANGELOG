v0.1.0.20110102:
 * added the error.LoginError exception for login errors
 * started to add tests for db.login function

v0.1.0.20101231:
 * moved the login function to the db.__init__ to let it used just after
   setting up the database without importing any new module
 * updated the example in the docstring of the template.AssetTemplate

v0.1.0.20101229.3:
 * generalized the Template class. Now every Entity can be assigned to a
   template, it is not limited with Assets or References.
 * 

v0.1.0.20101229.2:
 * entity.SimpleEntity.name now can have white spaces, but not at the beggining
   or end, just in the middle
 * done mapping template.Template class

v0.1.0.20101229.1:
 * trying to create a session system with Beaker, to hold user login
   information

 * renamed extensions module to ext
 * added roadmap to docs

v0.1.0.20101228:
 * created the block of database tests
 * added stalker.db.meta.__mappers__ list to hold the mappers and use it to
   check if anything is already mapped
 * added tests for db initialization
 * removed the whole stalker.models.unit module from SOM, only TimeUnit was
   usable in some cases, but in fact it is also not important, the only object
   using TimeUnit was the Project class and it can go well without it. Don't
   need to make things more complex than it needs to be.
 * increased the version number to 0.1.0 to follow the stalker roadmap

v0.0.1.20101227:
 * the test_db is converted to a proper unittest which is testing all the
   models one by one
 * test/db renamed to test/z_db to let nose run it latest to solve the problem
   about mocker and sqlalchemy fighting each other.
 * Mapping syntax is changed a little bit, now to do the mapping, the
   <mapper>.setup() function needs to be called to be able to do the mapping
   any time
 * started adding tests for every class in SOM

v0.0.1.20101226:
 * in user.User the last_name attribute could be an empty string
 * removed SimpleEntity, TaggedEntity and introduced StatusedEntity to make the
   inheritance clear and let users to find somebody to blame by moving all the
   audit information to the the SimpleEntity class in which everything is
   inherited from. Now even a Tag has audit information.

 * started to implement:
   * a database entry point
   * a customizable object model and database tables
   * an automatic mapper to map the objects and tables together according to
     user settings
   things can change a lot in this phase, I'm just trying to figure out the
   best possible way to do it.
 * added a new entity type called TaggedEntity which derives from SimpleEntity,
   and moved all the tag related attributes of SimpleEntity to TaggedEntity,
   and all the child classes deriving from SimpleEntity now derives from
   TaggedEntity, also moved the tests related with tag in SimpleEntity to
   TaggedEntity.
