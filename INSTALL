Thanks for downloading Stalker.

To install it, make sure you have Python 2.6 or greater installed. Then run
this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

Note this requires a working Internet connection if you don't already have the
Python utility "setuptools" installed.

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "stalker" directory to Python's
site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation
lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.6)
    C:\\PYTHON\site-packages         (Windows)

This second solution does not require a working Internet connection; it
bypasses "setuptools" entirely.

For more detailed instructions, see docs/index.html.
